              A class is a collection of properties and traits shared by a group of objects. All classes are also objects in Ruby.</td>
            <td class="sh"><h4>Object:</h4>
             Everything in Ruby is an Object.  Objects represent a single instance of something in Ruby. It can be an integer, string, array, or an entire class. </td>

            <td class="left"><h4>String:</h4>Strings are text in Ruby. A string can be an empty string, represented by "", or a full page of text.</td>

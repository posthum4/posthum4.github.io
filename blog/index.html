        <h3>Phase 0 is in the books!</h3>
        <p>Well I guess it is in a blog, not a book. But that is inconsequential becase it is history.  The last 9 week have been a crazy ride.  Working fulltime and trying to spend as much time as possible on the phase 0 material was a challenge.  I mean that figuratively and literally. The topics covered in just a few weeks included so many topics I feel I could spend a lifetime studying them an still not know everything. So I just remind myself that this is the first step in a long journey to learn new and exciting things. Feel free to take a look at what my thoughts were during phase 0</p>

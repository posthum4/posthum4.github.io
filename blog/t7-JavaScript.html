    <h1>Ruby built in Methods and Javascript Loops</h1>

        After spending a week working in javascript I see why people say Ruby is an easy language to type.  One difference that highlights this for me is the number of built in Ruby methods vs those in javascript.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a pairing session this week my partner and spent nearly fifteen minutes trying to get a method in javascript to work that didn't even exist.  I am not going to go into the error handling in javascript. That would be a different post.  Much of this time would not have been waste if we wrote better tests on the code, but why would .reverse not work on a string in javascript?  This is not the only method that is not available.
      </p>
      <p>
        Javascript uses for loops to accomplish what many of the pre-built Ruby methods would.  Once you get used to this concept the loops become almost second nature to type.  However, it isn't the extra text that I didn't like it is the readability of the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading: </br></br>
        "mytext".reverse is much easier than</br></br>
        rev_str = ""</br>
        for(i = rev_str.length-1; i >= 0; i--){</br>
        rev_str += string[i]}
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems like just a matter of time before some of these methods get added, but it can't come soon enough.

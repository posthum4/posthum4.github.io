      Using git and GitHub for the first time this week has been been enjoyable and enlightening.  I haven't even used it for any development but I can see how it could add value to so many users.  The value is in how it controls different versions of the same content.

      I currently find myself creating training documentation for salespeople with another member of my team. No central place exists to store the different docuemnts, and I am not the subject expert.  That means I spend my time trying to hunt down people who wrote the content to see if it is still relevant.  Having a system to track the current version of these files is incredibly helpful.

      With git everyone has a simple way to track any change to any file they have on their computer.  Each edit to a powerpoint or white paper is tracked locally on your computer. When the edits are finished git will display all the files with edits and let you decide if you want to save those to the most recent training file.

      If git makes it easy for a single to user version control, GitHub makes it easy for everyone to use version control on the same content.  A team can work collectivly on the same program from anywhere they want!

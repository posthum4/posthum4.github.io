    <h1>Values</h1>

      <p>In general I try to live up to these values at a 5, when measured on a sacle from 1 to 5.
        <ul>
          <li>Knowledge</li>
          <li>Self-awareness</li>
          <li>Physical challenge</li>
          <li>Self-reliance</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Knowledge is the value that I try to live up to more than others. Knowledge feels like a prerequisite for so many other values it would be hard to put them higher on the list.
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How you can be self-aware without the knowledge of your own behavior and tendencies?
          </li>
          <li>How can you be self-reliant if you are to afraid to trust your ability to accomplish your goals?
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>If you are willing to open up your mind and learn what makes you angry, happy, motivated, etc. you will take away the fear and anxiety that allows you to live other values.
      </p>
      <p>If you value the importance of knowledge it is likely something you try and pass along to others.  In my role as a Salesforce.com specialist I am frequently asked about reporting capabilities. My response to each of these requests is always the same. For full disclosure some co-workers probably stopped asking me questions because I refuse to just complete their request.  My goal is to make sure they fully understand what information is available to them and how to access it in reports.  Teach a person to fish, don't just give them a fish or they will come to rely on you for handouts.

          As a beginner learning Ruby it is not clear at first glance what are the differences between arrays and hashes.  Even when researching the topic it took a while to find an explination that resonated with me.  The best I found was to use hashes when the location of a value in the list is important, and use arrays when it is not.
        </p>

        <p>
          Why is it difficult to tell which option to use?  Becuase arrays and hashes are very similar.  Both are collections that can have  values added, removed, accessed, and manipulated. But there is one main difference.  That difference is how the location of each value in the collection is specified.

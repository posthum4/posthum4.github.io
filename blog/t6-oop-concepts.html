    <h1>Classes and Modules</h1>

    In the not too distant past when I was "retired" I tried to take the self taught programming path.  That time around I decided Java was a good choice becuase there were so many resources available for free.  Like Ruby, Java is an object oriented language so one of the first things you learn about are Classes.  A class can be created to define a collection of traits that are shared among similar objects.  And guess what a class can be a parent or child of another class.  That means it can inheirit and pass along those traits to others.  My aha moment was thinking it is like a kid who can use some traits from its mom and some from its dad.  I thought most other object oriented languages followed suit.  You can imagine my surprise when I read that classes can only inherit from one class in Ruby.  Everyone said ruby is amount less code. How can that be if you need a new method or class if a child class need differnt traits.  Then they introduced modules in the next sentence. Don't you hate it when they do that?

    A module is a class in the Ruby core library. It give you the ability to mix in new inheritance with out having to specify any new super class.  A second benefit is that modules cannot be created as instanes.  That keeps the methods they contain in one place.  You don't have to worry about them being pulled into and instance and then overwritten.  I look forward to learning how to effectively use modules when my programs get to be large enough.

    <h1>Positioning Elements with CSS</h1>

          One important function of CSS is being able to place each HTML element exactly where it should go. I sure wish I would have read more about CSS positioning before jumping into my stylesheet!  What's a stylesheet you ask? A stylesheet is what web developers use to add design features, formatting, and structure to the HTML elements of a web site.  The stylesheet is a blank slate with unlimited possibilities.  It can perform a single task, say making the text color of, "Hello world" red. Or as complex as designing the biggest ecommerce site on the internet.

          To position HTLM you have to know the natural flow of each document.  By default the elements will be displayed from top to bottom in a static order as they are typed.  If you have a block for your header, another for the body, and a footer, you will see them positioned vertically along the left of the screen with no overlap.  Even if the body is just one pixel it will still move the footer down to the bottom of the screen.  This format is perfect for some sites, but others need to have more complex layouts. That is were positioning enters the picture.

          Static is the default position of HTML. Each new element will be placed on the page as it relates to the element that preceded it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fixed positioning is another option.  This fixes that element to the page and it doesn't move.  Not matter how much you scroll in any direction. These elements are locked where you placed them. This is helpful for navigation or tool bars placed around the edge of a site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Absolute positioning gives you the ability to attach an element to any specific point on the page. It takes an element out of the natural order of the document. Using absolute positioning with no other attributes moves the element to the top left corner of its parent element.  The remaining elements on the page move up in the document order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Relative positioning is the last option.  This was the most difficult one for me to pick up.  It moves an element in relation to where it is currently positioned.  However, it doesn't affect the location of any other elements on the page. That wasn't that difficult. The part I kept missing was that it is only relative to the closest element above it, that does not static positioning.
        </p>

          I found the best way to really learn each style was to experiment.  But start slow. Add one element to a page and give it each of the styles and see what happens. Then add a second element and do the same thing. This way you can see the different results one at a time. With no other noise or clutter on the page. I hope this helps!

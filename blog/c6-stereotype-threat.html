          In sixth grade I remember having a teacher who would always refer to a group of students as the "cool group".  At the time I remember thinking there wasn't much cool about me. I was an awkward teenager with braces and a bowl cut.  Granted bowl cuts were the thing to do, but I used sun-in for good measure to really make the bowl pop.  What was so cool about that?  But that didn't matter, when some one in a position of authority tells you you're cool you have to be right?

          My experience in life is probably better described as a self fulfilling prophesy than experiencing stereotype threat.  Stereotype threat is the theory that people perform worse in situations where they feel a need to disprove a negative stereotype.  The example that made the point for me was the group of Asian women who took two math tests.  In the first they associated with being Asian and scored above average.  They underperformed when taking a similar test that emphasized the stereotype women are bad at math.  Can an a group affiliation mean that much?

          After looking back at different experiences in my life I think it can.  For all the times you are called "cool" you really do start to feel cool. After a while it becomes part of your identity.  But what if being cool isn't so cool anymore?  You have to evaluate how cool you think you really are.  Maybe you try extra hard to be even cooler that cool, you want to be ice cold, and you just make it worse.  All of a sudden you're not cool, but not the cool kind of not cool.  Of course I use an example that is over the top to make a point.  When something you identify with is cast in a negative light it can have a material impact on how you react.  That reaction often has a negative impact on performance.

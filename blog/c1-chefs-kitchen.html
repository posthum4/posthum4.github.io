          The DBC experience seems like one I would enjoy very much. I really think the expectations are clearly set and all the information I have seen so far reaffims those expectations.

          Other than some administrative snafus getting access to the curriculum everything have been great. And we are here to learn to be developers not EAs.

          From wanting the video it was interesting to think of the anology that we are on a walk to Seattle and everything is relative.  What seems like a huge gap in ability now is nothing in the grand scheme of things. If we trust that the admission process tries to select the most appropriate people to go on this journey with then this will be a fun ride?

          If you are anything like me you hate working in teams.  In school and in work have come to dread group assignments.  When it comes close to the deadline I usually just ends up being a few people picking up the slack for other who didn't provide much. Other than having some really detailed reasons they couldn't help.  I always thought to myself if they just worked as hard on project as they did on their excuse they could be the MVP.  However, when I look all the way back to my childhood this was not always the case.

          Growing up I played sports like a lot of other kids.  Some teams competed for State Championships others couldn't win a game unless the other team no showed. One of those was a mens league team in college. That is a for a different post.  The good team all had three things in common:
        <ul>
          <li>Strong leadership from coaches and players</li>
          <li>Feedback was always given for ways to improve</li>
          <li>People were accountable for how they responded to the feedback</li>
        </ul>
          I can already hear some people saying that a sports team is not the same thing as a pairing session.  That is true, but from this perspective they are very similar.  Both should have a defined objective, designated responsibilities and a plan to execute.  In sports you want to win the game, everyone has a position and runs knows the game plan.  Unfortunately, most group projects I have working on were not this clear. It was not clear who was in charge, the roles were vague and in some cases it wasn't even clear what we were trying to do! When this happens it is very hard to give any real feedback.

          Phase 0 of DBC has changed by perception of group projects for the better. Each pairing session is clearly defined, only two roles are needed and they even give feedback about feedback.  Kind, actionable, and specific is the guide for all feedback.  It is delivered in a way that is truthful, but doesn't personally point out any issues. Specificity makes it possible to take action and try to improve the next challenge.

          DBC has made working in groups enjoyable again.  Each challenge is a true collaboration that pairs two people do get a result that is better than what I should have done on my own.

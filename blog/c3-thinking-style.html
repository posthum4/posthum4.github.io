          If you're like me you end up feeling very torn after taking any personality assessment.  Every time I get the results to a test like this I get the same answer. My personality is split.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Gregorc Thinking Style test was no different.  Like many other systems it to identify major traits and preferences of an individual.  This model evaluates people based on their perceptual quality and their ordering ability.</br></br>
          Perceptual Qualities:

          <ul>
          <li>Concrete thinkers see things literally, as they are</li>
          <li>Abstract thinkers will use intuition and imagination</li>
          </ul>
          Ordering Ability:
          <ul>
            <li>Sequential thinkers prefer a step by step in approaching problems </li>
            <li>Random thinkers group information into chunks over following a linear sequence</li>
          </ul>

          These qualities are combined to produce four styles:
          <ul>
            <li>Concrete Sequential</li>
            <li>Concrete Random</li>
            <li>Abstract Sequential</li>
            <li>Abstract Random</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          My score was very close for the Concrete Random and Abstract Sequential thinking style.  What does that mean?  It means I'm screwed.  No it doesn't, I kid.  To me it means people with these traits are very independent, but have a hard time picking a working style.  We might seem erratic.  Part of me wants to dive right into a problem the other part keeps telling me to slow down, evaluate the challenge. After three weeks of DBC, I can say this style is an asset and weakness at the same time.  I've spent hours going around in circles.  A solution is pseudocoded half way, but before it's finished I have experimented with countless possible solutions.  When none work I go back to the plan.  Unfortunately at this point it isn't even clear what the problem was!!

          The other styles, well they were a distant third and forth.  So learning to work with my two dominant styles is going to be important.  The planning phase of a project should be well planned and linear, the implementation of that plan will likely require some experimentation.  This is an effective approach. But the reverse approach is not.  Experimenting before a solution is fully thought out leads to time being wasted.  Working on a plan that will never work is not a good idea.  How can this be a positive?
        </p>
        <p>
          As a person with a strong CR and AS style it is important to know when each one is a benefit and a negative.  Measure twice cut once is a popular phrase for a reason. To me that means thinking through different options when psuedocoding a problem. Not spending time trying to debug code that was never correct from the start.  This is easier said than done, but being aware of different learning styles is another tool in the belt.  I hope I stay aware of the strengths and weaknesses of each.

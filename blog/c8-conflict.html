    <h1>Conflict Review</h1>

    One conflict I remember well spanned several months.  My role was an operations manager at a start up, how cliche right? . I developed, implemented, and managed the processes to help meet our client's objectives.  The source of the conflict was the relationship manger from my company. He would agree to accommodate requirements changes and provided time-lines without consulting the rest of the team.  Many of the requests being agreed to were in direct conflict with other requirements.  For example the client wanted a turn around on contracts to be less than 24 hours.  However, they also required that their legal team be able to review specific contracts.  That SLA by itself was longer than 24 hours!  I could keep going but the computer might not have enough memory.

  <p>
    Being a person who places a high value on competence and making logical decisions I struggled to contain my frustration.  How can you agree to this knowing it cannot be done? How can the client requests this knowing their own SLA?  Don't they know my team and I already work around the clock to meet the deadlines?
  </p>
  <p>
    To this day, I am not sure if they understood the contents of the agreement.  But what I failed to recognize was our reason for saying yes to every request.  The relationship manger was told to do whatever it took to get the agreement signed.  The contract itself was the goal.  After that we could tell other clients we they would be left behind if they didn't sign up.  Now  I don't think this was a very good strategy and in the end it was not very effective but that is a different topic.  My frustration was caused by not understanding the motivation of everyone involved.

    Looking back I learned an important lesson.  When I find myself getting frustrated because things don't "make sense", it's time to ask why.  Not just assume everyone making decisions is unqualified. Most of the time they are also trying to balance competing objectives.  Understanding others goals and objectives makes it easier to empathize with them and work together.

          If you google problems facing tech many of the issues you find are topical. Mobile, it security, user privacy and the list goes on. All are very real issues, but many of them can only be overcome by a qualified workforce of people who can come up with innovative solutions. That gets to the heart of the biggest issue in Tech. Attraching and training people, now.

          Technology is part of almost every industry. So why does it still seem to be such a challenge getting people to pursue it as a career?  As a relative new comer to the 'job' party, tech isn't always well understood.  More established industries have a hard time recruiting new talent. From my owner experience, I remember graduating with a finance degree thinking, "what am I suppose to do with this?". That is the issue facing tech.  Schools are good at teaching people skills. They are not good at explaining to students how to use those skills in the real world. Even when they do teach the skills it is not a degree people want to spend 4 years persuing.

          It doesn't take a computer science degree to get a job in tech today. So why is that the only option offered by most universities?  This created a void that needed to be filled.  Schools like DBC have stepped in to fill the void. By lowering the barrier to entry more people will be attracted to tech.  Investing 20 weeks is much easier than 4 years.  This doesn't mean grads will become the founder of Facebook or Google. It means more people get an opportunity they wouldn't otherwise have. Programs that focus on training the next generation of tech workers are important. Don't get me wrong.  However, it does not lessen the immediate need for a larger and more divere workforce in technology.

    Classes in Ruby, like other programming languages, group related pieces of information together in a meaningful way.  The variable and actions provided by each class will make you code more effieient to type and run.  In the example I will use it should become clear how classes are used and why they are important.
  </p>

  <p>
    Remember getting your class schedlue the first time you had six or seven different periods in school? For me it was in sixth grade. The seven classes on the list all shared the same common information:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Teacher
          Subject
          Room Number
          Days of the Week
          Start
          End
        </li>
      </ul>
      I could keep going but you should get the jist.  Do you think the person who created teh schedule recreated that group of fields for each student? I doubt it. A more likely answer is they created a class for Class.
    </p>
    <p>
      class Class
        attr_reader :subject, :teacher, :room
        attr_accessor :days_of_week, :start, :end

        def initialize(subject, teacher, room)
          @subject = subject
          @teacher = teacher
          @room = room
        end

        def add_students(students)
          @students = []
          students.each{|s| @students << s}
        end

        def set_schedule(start, end, days_of_week)
          @start = start
          @end = end
          @days_of_week = days_of_week
        end
      end
    </p>
    <p>
      With these few lines of code you can create all the Classes you want from this single class.  You don't have to create the list of variables for each one.  Just create an instance of the Class object.  Set the teacher, subject and room number to get a new course.  That is the initialize method.  Now you have an object that is an instance of the class Class.  This class has methods that will let you add students and set the schedule represented by the other def code blocks.  Eash instance of a Class will also be able to tell you what all the information is. The attr lines at the top give you the ability to read or write each variable in the instance of the class.
    </p>
    <p>
      By simply calling a few lines of code you can create a new math class.

      math_class = Class.new("math","Mrs. Trout", 205)
      math_class.set_schedule("9:00 AM", "9:50 AM", ["M", "T", "W", "Th"])
      math_class.add_students([Ryan, Ted, Sally, Jennifer, Bill])

      I hope by now you can see how classes make it easier to create Classes.
